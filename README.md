College Project: Data Integration and Management using Oracle Database, PL/SQL, and Oracle Data Integrator (ODI)

Overview

This project was developed as part of my college coursework, focusing on data integration and management using Oracle Database, PL/SQL, and Oracle Data Integrator (ODI). The main goal of this project was to design, develop, and implement a robust data integration solution that could handle complex data transformations and ensure data consistency across different systems.

Project Objectives

Design and Develop a Relational Database: Created a comprehensive Oracle database schema tailored to meet the project's requirements, including tables, views, indexes, and relationships.

Implement Business Logic using PL/SQL: Developed and optimized PL/SQL procedures, functions, and triggers to enforce business rules, automate processes, and ensure data integrity.

Data Integration using ODI: Utilized Oracle Data Integrator (ODI) for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes. This included designing and implementing ODI mappings, packages, and scenarios to integrate data from multiple sources.

Technologies Used

Database: Oracle Database 19c

Programming Language: PL/SQL

ETL Tool: Oracle Data Integrator (ODI)

Development Environment: Oracle SQL Developer, ODI Studio

Key Features

Database Design: Developed a normalized database schema, ensuring referential integrity and optimizing for performance.

Stored Procedures and Functions: Wrote complex PL/SQL stored procedures and functions to handle business logic, including data validation, transformation, and aggregation.

Triggers and Exception Handling: Implemented triggers for automated tasks and exception handling to manage errors gracefully and maintain data integrity.

ETL Processes: Designed ODI mappings and workflows to extract data from multiple sources, perform necessary transformations, and load the data into the target Oracle Database.

Data Quality and Consistency: Ensured data quality and consistency throughout the ETL process by implementing validation rules and data cleansing techniques.

Challenges and Solutions

Data Volume Management: Optimized ETL processes to handle large volumes of data efficiently by leveraging ODI parallelism and tuning PL/SQL code.

Complex Transformations: Managed complex data transformations using ODI's built-in components and custom PL/SQL code to meet specific business requirements.

Outcomes

Successfully integrated data from disparate sources into a unified Oracle Database.
Improved data processing efficiency and accuracy through well-structured PL/SQL and ODI workflows.
Gained hands-on experience in database design, PL/SQL programming, and data integration using Oracle technologies.
